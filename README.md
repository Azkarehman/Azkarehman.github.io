heading: Dual-Stage Deeply Supervised Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for Mandibular Canal Segmentation in CBCT Scans

text: Accurate segmentation of mandibular canals in lower jaws is important in dental implantology. Medical experts manually determine the implant position and dimensions from 3D CT images to avoid damaging the mandibular nerve inside the canal. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-stage deep learning-based scheme for the automatic segmentation of the mandibular canal. In particular, we first enhance the CBCT scans by employing the novel histogram-based dynamic windowing scheme, which improves the visibility of mandibular canals. After enhancement, we designed 3D deeply supervised attention UNet architecture for localizing the Volumes Of Interest (VOIs), which contain the mandibular canals (i.e., left and right canals). Finally, we employed the Multi-Scale input Residual UNet (MSiR-UNet) architecture to segment the mandibular canals using VOIs accurately. The proposed method has been rigorously evaluated on 500 and 15 CBCT scans from our dataset and from the public dataset, respectively. The results demonstrate that our technique improves the existing performance of mandibular canal segmentation to a clinically acceptable range. Moreover, it is robust against the types of CBCT scans in terms of field of view.

heading : MEDS-Net: Self-Distilled Multi-Encoders Network with Bi-Direction Maximum Intensity projections for Lung Nodule Detection

text: In this study, we propose a lung nodule detection scheme which fully incorporates the clinic workflow of radiologists. Particularly, we exploit Bi-Directional Maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of various thicknesses (i.e., 3, 5 and 10mm) along with a 3D patch of CT scan, consisting of 10 adjacent slices to feed into self-distillation-based Multi-Encoders Network (MEDS-Net). The proposed architecture first condenses 3D patch input to three channels by using a dense block which consists of dense units which effectively examine the nodule presence from 2D axial slices. This condensed information, along with the forward and backward MIP images, is fed to three different encoders to learn the most meaningful representation, which is forwarded into the decoded block at various levels. At the decoder block, we employ a self-distillation mechanism by connecting the distillation block, which contains five lung nodule detectors. It helps to expedite the convergence and improves the learning ability of the proposed architecture. Finally, the proposed scheme reduces the false positives by complementing the main detector with auxiliary detectors. The proposed scheme has been rigorously evaluated on 888 scans of LUNA16 dataset and obtained a CPM score of 93.6\%. The results demonstrate that incorporating of bi-direction MIP images enables MEDS-Net to effectively distinguish nodules from surroundings which help to achieve the sensitivity of 91.5% and 92.8% with false positives rate of 0.25 and 0.5 per scan, respectively.
